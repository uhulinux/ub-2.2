 This is a version of 'cron' that is known to run on most systems.  It
 is functionally based on the SysV cron, which means that each user can have
 their own crontab file (all crontab files are stored in a read-protected
-directory, usually /var/cron/tabs).  No direct support is provided for
+directory, /var/spool/cron/tabs).  No direct support is provided for
 'at'; you can continue to run 'atrun' from the crontab as you have been
 doing.  If you don't have atrun (i.e., System V) you are in trouble.
 
 A messages is logged each time a command is executed; also, the files
-"allow" and "deny" in /var/cron can be used to control access to the
+"allow" and "deny" in /var/spool/cron can be used to control access to the
 "crontab" command (which installs crontabs).  It hasn't been tested on
 SysV, although some effort has gone into making the port an easy one.
