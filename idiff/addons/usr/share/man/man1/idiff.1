       _I_d_i_f_f  runs  _d_i_f_f(1)  on the specified files and then pre-
       sents each chunk of _d_i_f_f output and offers  the  user  the
       option  of  choosing the ``from'' part or the ``to'' part,
       or editing the parts.  _I_d_i_f_f produces the selected  pieces
       in the proper order in a file called _i_d_i_f_f_._o_u_t.

       After  each chunk is presented, _i_d_i_f_f will prompt the user
       (with a `? ') for a command.  The valid commands are:

       <<      Take the ``from'' portion of the  displayed  chunk.
              This  is  the  portion which was extracted from the
              first file specified.

       >>      Take the ``to'' portion  of  the  displayed  chunk.
              This  corresponds to that extracted from the second
              file specified.

       ee      Invoke an editor on the  chunk.   The  contents  of
              shell variable EDITOR select the editor to be used.
              The default is _/_b_i_n_/_e_d.  Whatever  is  written  out
              from _e_d will be placed into the final output.

       qq<<     Take all the rest of the '<' choices automatically.
              Think of this as ``quit from''.

       qq>>     Take all the rest of the '>' choices automatically.
              Think of this as ``quit to''.

       !!      Pass  the  command buffer to the shell for process-
              ing.

       All code that _d_i_f_f considers identical in both input files
       is automatically put into the output file.

       It  is  not  possible  to pass any options to _d_i_f_f through
       _i_d_i_f_f_.  Nor can you use `-' as a filename argument.
