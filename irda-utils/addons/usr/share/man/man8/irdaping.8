.SH NAME
irdaping \- sends IrDA test frames
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBirdaping\fR [ \fB\fIdaddr\fB\fR ] [ \fB\fI-s framesize\fB\fR ]

.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fBdaddr\fR ...
.PP
\fB-s framesize\fR ...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This is a program similar to \fBping(8)\fR. It sends IrDA test frames (added some userdata which contains the frame number and the time the frame was sent). You can change the size of the frame by using the \fB-s\fR option. To get \fBdaddr\fR you
may use \fBirdadump\fR.
.PP
\fBirdaping\fR must be run as root or installed setuid root, 
as it requires root privileges.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
\fBirdaping <daddr> [-s <framesize>]\fR
.PP
You may use an \fBalias\fR, which does not use any parameter 
\fBalias irping="irdaping \\`grep daddr /proc/net/irda/discovery|sed s/.*daddr://\\`"\fR
It works fine when there is only one discovered client.
