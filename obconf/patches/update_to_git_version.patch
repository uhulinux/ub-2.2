-1 Notes on the Free Translation Project
-***************************************
-
-Free software is going international!  The Free Translation Project is
-a way to get maintainers of free software, translators, and users all
-together, so that free software will gradually become able to speak many
-languages.  A few packages already provide translations for their
-messages.
-
-   If you found this `ABOUT-NLS' file inside a distribution, you may
-assume that the distributed package does use GNU `gettext' internally,
-itself available at your nearest GNU archive site.  But you do _not_
-need to install GNU `gettext' prior to configuring, installing or using
-this package with messages translated.
-
-   Installers will find here some useful hints.  These notes also
-explain how users should proceed for getting the programs to use the
-available translations.  They tell how people wanting to contribute and
-work on translations can contact the appropriate team.
-
-   When reporting bugs in the `intl/' directory or bugs which may be
-related to internationalization, you should tell about the version of
-`gettext' which is used.  The information can be found in the
-`intl/VERSION' file, in internationalized packages.
-
-1.1 Quick configuration advice
-==============================
-
-If you want to exploit the full power of internationalization, you
-should configure it using
-
-     ./configure --with-included-gettext
-
-to force usage of internationalizing routines provided within this
-package, despite the existence of internationalizing capabilities in the
-operating system where this package is being installed.  So far, only
-the `gettext' implementation in the GNU C library version 2 provides as
-many features (such as locale alias, message inheritance, automatic
-charset conversion or plural form handling) as the implementation here.
-It is also not possible to offer this additional functionality on top
-of a `catgets' implementation.  Future versions of GNU `gettext' will
-very likely convey even more functionality.  So it might be a good idea
-to change to GNU `gettext' as soon as possible.
-
-   So you need _not_ provide this option if you are using GNU libc 2 or
-you have installed a recent copy of the GNU gettext package with the
-included `libintl'.
-
-1.2 INSTALL Matters
-===================
-
-Some packages are "localizable" when properly installed; the programs
-they contain can be made to speak your own native language.  Most such
-packages use GNU `gettext'.  Other packages have their own ways to
-internationalization, predating GNU `gettext'.
-
-   By default, this package will be installed to allow translation of
-messages.  It will automatically detect whether the system already
-provides the GNU `gettext' functions.  If not, the included GNU
-`gettext' library will be used.  This library is wholly contained
-within this package, usually in the `intl/' subdirectory, so prior
-installation of the GNU `gettext' package is _not_ required.
-Installers may use special options at configuration time for changing
-the default behaviour.  The commands:
-
-     ./configure --with-included-gettext
-     ./configure --disable-nls
-
-will, respectively, bypass any pre-existing `gettext' to use the
-internationalizing routines provided within this package, or else,
-_totally_ disable translation of messages.
-
-   When you already have GNU `gettext' installed on your system and run
-configure without an option for your new package, `configure' will
-probably detect the previously built and installed `libintl.a' file and
-will decide to use this.  This might not be desirable.  You should use
-the more recent version of the GNU `gettext' library.  I.e. if the file
-`intl/VERSION' shows that the library which comes with this package is
-more recent, you should use
-
-     ./configure --with-included-gettext
-
-to prevent auto-detection.
-
-   The configuration process will not test for the `catgets' function
-and therefore it will not be used.  The reason is that even an
-emulation of `gettext' on top of `catgets' could not provide all the
-extensions of the GNU `gettext' library.
-
-   Internationalized packages usually have many `po/LL.po' files, where
-LL gives an ISO 639 two-letter code identifying the language.  Unless
-translations have been forbidden at `configure' time by using the
-`--disable-nls' switch, all available translations are installed
-together with the package.  However, the environment variable `LINGUAS'
-may be set, prior to configuration, to limit the installed set.
-`LINGUAS' should then contain a space separated list of two-letter
-codes, stating which languages are allowed.
-
-1.3 Using This Package
-======================
-
-As a user, if your language has been installed for this package, you
-only have to set the `LANG' environment variable to the appropriate
-`LL_CC' combination.  Here `LL' is an ISO 639 two-letter language code,
-and `CC' is an ISO 3166 two-letter country code.  For example, let's
-suppose that you speak German and live in Germany.  At the shell
-prompt, merely execute `setenv LANG de_DE' (in `csh'),
-`export LANG; LANG=de_DE' (in `sh') or `export LANG=de_DE' (in `bash').
-This can be done from your `.login' or `.profile' file, once and for
-all.
-
-   You might think that the country code specification is redundant.
-But in fact, some languages have dialects in different countries.  For
-example, `de_AT' is used for Austria, and `pt_BR' for Brazil.  The
-country code serves to distinguish the dialects.
-
-   The locale naming convention of `LL_CC', with `LL' denoting the
-language and `CC' denoting the country, is the one use on systems based
-on GNU libc.  On other systems, some variations of this scheme are
-used, such as `LL' or `LL_CC.ENCODING'.  You can get the list of
-locales supported by your system for your language by running the
-command `locale -a | grep '^LL''.
-
-   Not all programs have translations for all languages.  By default, an
-English message is shown in place of a nonexistent translation.  If you
-understand other languages, you can set up a priority list of languages.
-This is done through a different environment variable, called
-`LANGUAGE'.  GNU `gettext' gives preference to `LANGUAGE' over `LANG'
-for the purpose of message handling, but you still need to have `LANG'
-set to the primary language; this is required by other parts of the
-system libraries.  For example, some Swedish users who would rather
-read translations in German than English for when Swedish is not
-available, set `LANGUAGE' to `sv:de' while leaving `LANG' to `sv_SE'.
-
-   Special advice for Norwegian users: The language code for Norwegian
-bokma*l changed from `no' to `nb' recently (in 2003).  During the
-transition period, while some message catalogs for this language are
-installed under `nb' and some older ones under `no', it's recommended
-for Norwegian users to set `LANGUAGE' to `nb:no' so that both newer and
-older translations are used.
-
-   In the `LANGUAGE' environment variable, but not in the `LANG'
-environment variable, `LL_CC' combinations can be abbreviated as `LL'
-to denote the language's main dialect.  For example, `de' is equivalent
-to `de_DE' (German as spoken in Germany), and `pt' to `pt_PT'
-(Portuguese as spoken in Portugal) in this context.
-
-1.4 Translating Teams
-=====================
-
-For the Free Translation Project to be a success, we need interested
-people who like their own language and write it well, and who are also
-able to synergize with other translators speaking the same language.
-Each translation team has its own mailing list.  The up-to-date list of
-teams can be found at the Free Translation Project's homepage,
-`http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/contrib/po/HTML/', in the "National teams"
-area.
-
-   If you'd like to volunteer to _work_ at translating messages, you
-should become a member of the translating team for your own language.
-The subscribing address is _not_ the same as the list itself, it has
-`-request' appended.  For example, speakers of Swedish can send a
-message to `sv-request@li.org', having this message body:
-
-     subscribe
-
-   Keep in mind that team members are expected to participate
-_actively_ in translations, or at solving translational difficulties,
-rather than merely lurking around.  If your team does not exist yet and
-you want to start one, or if you are unsure about what to do or how to
-get started, please write to `translation@iro.umontreal.ca' to reach the
-coordinator for all translator teams.
-
-   The English team is special.  It works at improving and uniformizing
-the terminology in use.  Proven linguistic skill are praised more than
-programming skill, here.
-
-1.5 Available Packages
-======================
-
-Languages are not equally supported in all packages.  The following
-matrix shows the current state of internationalization, as of July
-2006.  The matrix shows, in regard of each package, for which languages
-PO files have been submitted to translation coordination, with a
-translation percentage of at least 50%.

-   Some counters in the preceding matrix are higher than the number of
-visible blocks let us expect.  This is because a few extra PO files are
-used for implementing regional variants of languages, or language
-dialects.
-
-   For a PO file in the matrix above to be effective, the package to
-which it applies should also have been internationalized and
-distributed as such by its maintainer.  There might be an observable
-lag between the mere existence a PO file and its wide availability in a
-distribution.
-
-   If July 2006 seems to be old, you may fetch a more recent copy of
-this `ABOUT-NLS' file on most GNU archive sites.  The most up-to-date

-1.6 Using `gettext' in new packages
-===================================
-
-If you are writing a freely available program and want to
-internationalize it you are welcome to use GNU `gettext' in your
-package.  Of course you have to respect the GNU Library General Public
-License which covers the use of the GNU `gettext' library.  This means
-in particular that even non-free programs can use `libintl' as a shared
-library, whereas only free software can use `libintl' as a static
-library or use modified versions of `libintl'.
-
-   Once the sources are changed appropriately and the setup can handle
-the use of `gettext' the only thing missing are the translations.  The
-Free Translation Project is also available for packages which are not
-developed inside the GNU project.  Therefore the information given above
-applies also for every other Free Software Project.  Contact
-`translation@iro.umontreal.ca' to make the `.pot' files available to
-the translation teams.

-# For projects using AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR([foo]), Autoconf sets
-# $ac_aux_dir to `$srcdir/foo'.  In other projects, it is set to
-# `$srcdir', `$srcdir/..', or `$srcdir/../..'.
-#
-# Of course, Automake must honor this variable whenever it calls a
-# tool from the auxiliary directory.  The problem is that $srcdir (and
-# therefore $ac_aux_dir as well) can be either absolute or relative,
-# depending on how configure is run.  This is pretty annoying, since
-# it makes $ac_aux_dir quite unusable in subdirectories: in the top
-# source directory, any form will work fine, but in subdirectories a
-# relative path needs to be adjusted first.
-#
-# $ac_aux_dir/missing
-#    fails when called from a subdirectory if $ac_aux_dir is relative
-# $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing
-#    fails if $ac_aux_dir is absolute,
-#    fails when called from a subdirectory in a VPATH build with
-#          a relative $ac_aux_dir
-#
-# The reason of the latter failure is that $top_srcdir and $ac_aux_dir
-# are both prefixed by $srcdir.  In an in-source build this is usually
-# harmless because $srcdir is `.', but things will broke when you
-# start a VPATH build or use an absolute $srcdir.
-#
-# So we could use something similar to $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing,
-# iff we strip the leading $srcdir from $ac_aux_dir.  That would be:
-#   am_aux_dir='\$(top_srcdir)/'`expr "$ac_aux_dir" : "$srcdir//*\(.*\)"`
-# and then we would define $MISSING as
-#   MISSING="\${SHELL} $am_aux_dir/missing"
-# This will work as long as MISSING is not called from configure, because
-# unfortunately $(top_srcdir) has no meaning in configure.
-# However there are other variables, like CC, which are often used in
-# configure, and could therefore not use this "fixed" $ac_aux_dir.
-#
-# Another solution, used here, is to always expand $ac_aux_dir to an
-# absolute PATH.  The drawback is that using absolute paths prevent a
-# configured tree to be moved without reconfiguration.

-# installer happens to have an overly restrictive umask (e.g. 077).
-# This was a mistake.  There are at least two reasons why we must not

-#   - it causes special bits like SGID to be ignored,
-#   - it may be too restrictive (some setups expect 775 directories).
-#
-# Do not use -m 0755 and let people choose whatever they expect by
-# setting umask.
-#
-# We cannot accept any implementation of `mkdir' that recognizes `-p'.
-# Some implementations (such as Solaris 8's) are not thread-safe: if a
-# parallel make tries to run `mkdir -p a/b' and `mkdir -p a/c'

-# Configuration subroutine to validate and canonicalize a configuration type.
-# Supply the specified configuration type as an argument.
-# If it is invalid, we print an error message on stderr and exit with code 1.
-# Otherwise, we print the canonical config type on stdout and succeed.
-
-# This file is supposed to be the same for all GNU packages
-# and recognize all the CPU types, system types and aliases
-# that are meaningful with *any* GNU software.
-# Each package is responsible for reporting which valid configurations
-# it does not support.  The user should be able to distinguish
-# a failure to support a valid configuration from a meaningless
-# configuration.
-
-# The goal of this file is to map all the various variations of a given
-# machine specification into a single specification in the form:
-#	CPU_TYPE-MANUFACTURER-OPERATING_SYSTEM
-# or in some cases, the newer four-part form:
-#	CPU_TYPE-MANUFACTURER-KERNEL-OPERATING_SYSTEM
-# It is wrong to echo any other type of specification.

-\`configure' configures obconf 2.0.3 to adapt to many kinds of systems.
-
-Usage: $0 [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...
-
-To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
-VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.
-
-Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.
-
-Configuration:
-  -h, --help              display this help and exit
-      --help=short        display options specific to this package
-      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
-  -V, --version           display version information and exit
-  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking...' messages
-      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
-  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
-  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
-      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']
-
-Installation directories:
-  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
-			  [$ac_default_prefix]
-  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
-			  [PREFIX]
-
-By default, \`make install' will install all the files in
-\`$ac_default_prefix/bin', \`$ac_default_prefix/lib' etc.  You can specify
-an installation prefix other than \`$ac_default_prefix' using \`--prefix',
-for instance \`--prefix=\$HOME'.
-
-For better control, use the options below.
-
-Fine tuning of the installation directories:

-dnl Macro to add for using GNU gettext.
-
-dnl Usage: AM_GNU_GETTEXT([INTLSYMBOL], [NEEDSYMBOL], [INTLDIR]).
-dnl INTLSYMBOL can be one of 'external', 'no-libtool', 'use-libtool'. The
-dnl    default (if it is not specified or empty) is 'no-libtool'.
-dnl    INTLSYMBOL should be 'external' for packages with no intl directory,
-dnl    and 'no-libtool' or 'use-libtool' for packages with an intl directory.
-dnl    If INTLSYMBOL is 'use-libtool', then a libtool library
-dnl    $(top_builddir)/intl/libintl.la will be created (shared and/or static,
-dnl    depending on --{enable,disable}-{shared,static} and on the presence of
-dnl    AM-DISABLE-SHARED). If INTLSYMBOL is 'no-libtool', a static library
-dnl    $(top_builddir)/intl/libintl.a will be created.
-dnl If NEEDSYMBOL is specified and is 'need-ngettext', then GNU gettext
-dnl    implementations (in libc or libintl) without the ngettext() function
-dnl    will be ignored.  If NEEDSYMBOL is specified and is
-dnl    'need-formatstring-macros', then GNU gettext implementations that don't
-dnl    support the ISO C 99 <inttypes.h> formatstring macros will be ignored.
-dnl INTLDIR is used to find the intl libraries.  If empty,
-dnl    the value `$(top_builddir)/intl/' is used.
-dnl
-dnl The result of the configuration is one of three cases:
-dnl 1) GNU gettext, as included in the intl subdirectory, will be compiled
-dnl    and used.
-dnl    Catalog format: GNU --> install in $(datadir)
-dnl    Catalog extension: .mo after installation, .gmo in source tree
-dnl 2) GNU gettext has been found in the system's C library.
-dnl    Catalog format: GNU --> install in $(datadir)
-dnl    Catalog extension: .mo after installation, .gmo in source tree
-dnl 3) No internationalization, always use English msgid.
-dnl    Catalog format: none
-dnl    Catalog extension: none
-dnl If INTLSYMBOL is 'external', only cases 2 and 3 can occur.
-dnl The use of .gmo is historical (it was needed to avoid overwriting the
-dnl GNU format catalogs when building on a platform with an X/Open gettext),
-dnl but we keep it in order not to force irrelevant filename changes on the
-dnl maintainers.
