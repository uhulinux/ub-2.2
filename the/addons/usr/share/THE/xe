/*
 *  ----------------------------------------------------------------
 *  Execution of this program requires a license for uni-REXX on
 *  the host computer where it is to be run.  It also requires at
 *  minimum a license for uni-XEDIT Basic for each concurrent user.
 *  If editing options include the execution of complex macros, a
 *  license for uni-XEDIT Extended is required for each such user.
 *  ----------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *
 * X
 *
 * The X program invokes uni-XEDIT to edit a file.  When you end the
 * edit session, X then checks to see if the first line in the file
 * contains "#!/...".  If the file begins with "#!...", it is marked
 * as executable through a "chmod +x" Unix command.  This is useful when
 * creating uni-REXX programs.
 *
 *
 * Execute the X program by typing
 *
 *          x <filename> <options>
 *
 * where <filename> is the file to be edited, the <filename> may be
 * system independent and <options> may be other uni-XEDIT options
 * such as a profile.
